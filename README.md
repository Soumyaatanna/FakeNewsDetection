# **Fake News Detection**

A machine learning project for detecting and classifying fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and advanced machine learning algorithms.

---

## **Features**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings for better text representation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Passive Aggressive Classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for model assessment.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Flask (optional for deployment)

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soumyaatanna/FakeNewsDetection.git
## Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd FakeNewsDetection
```

## Install the Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
**Source:** Publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle)

The dataset includes columns for text content and labels indicating whether the news is real or fake.

## Usage

### Preprocess Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the text data.

### Train the Model
Train the chosen machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Deploy (Optional)
Use Flask or FastAPI to deploy the trained model as an API for real-time prediction.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any required environment variables:
```
# Example:
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

## Results
- Achieved a high accuracy score with **[model name, e.g., Logistic Regression]**.
- Consistent performance across training, validation, and test datasets.
